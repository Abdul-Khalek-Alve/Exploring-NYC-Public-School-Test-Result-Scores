# Exploring-NYC-Public-School-Test-Result-Scores
Every year, school test results impact the college admissions fate of millions of students.  In this project, I will use standardized test performance data from NYC's public schools to identify the schools with top math results, look at how performance varies by borough, and find the city's top ten performing schools-

1. Which NYC schools have the best math results?

2. Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?

3. Save your results as a pandas DataFrame called largest_std_dev.
